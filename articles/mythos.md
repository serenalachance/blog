I don't read /r/crossdressing often, but last night I came across an interesting post from a few days ago. The submitter had since deleted their account, but the post's text continues to exist for posterity:

> So, yeah, back in the wild days of the internet (Six or so years ago) I had around 30,000 myspace friends and a million and a half youtube views. I was pretty active in a lot of crossdressing and trans forums and websites and yeah, I did make a pretty hot woman (and I hope my pics back up my boasts, if not I'll look pretty foolish).
>
> Used to go out all the time, just out to regular bars and places, dressed almost every weekend for years, could pass as female pretty well too. Did lots of photo shoots and tons of videos too.
>
> But, when I was in my early twenties, I used to go out to cd meetups and I would see the old guys in their fifties, and the old guys online and vowed that I would give it up if ever I got old or ugly or fat.
>
> And while I never really gave it up for those reasons, I just sort of lost interest at one point and haven't wanted to indulge again, like something switched off in my brain. No idea why.
>
> Well, here are pics as promised: http://imgur.com/a/Jntx1#0

> Ask me anything you'd like.

Despite the account and linked images being deleted, and commenters not providing many significant clues, a non-redacted Imgur account name suggests that this was suggested by none other than the infamous Faith Dabrooke, one of the crossdressing pioneers of the Internet, and a girl who inspired many of us. Faith built and ran a website with a huge collection of personal snapshots back in the days when this was a non-trivial thing to do, and not just technically either&mdash;crossdressing was still an outlying activity constrained to the darkest corners of the Internet. She dubbed herself a genderflux revolutionary, and looking back years later, that honorific was prophetic.

What really touched me about this post was its mystery. As indicated by the various comments throughout, the submitter is a celebrated figure to most of the user base who was an important symbol to them in deeply meaningful ways. She stuck around to answer a few questions before deleting her account (and not for the first time; I've observed this pattern before), and striking as much from the record as possible before returning to anonymity. This parallels her original departure from the Internet, where she expunged her complete set of writings, images, and videos from across the web and disappeared; presumably for good (although it looks like she still holds her dot com). This led me to ponder how the Internet's crossdressing world, despite its limited size, has actually started to develop its own mythos complete with legendary figures.

The Wayback Machine has preserved a few of her writings, and a video or two has survived, but I was surprised at how little material I was able to drudge up. Apparently the [Streisand effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) doesn't apply to crossdressers.

The author also raises a few interesting points. Firstly, that she knew that one day she'd become the old middle-aged crossdresser who no longer convinces anybody, and this was a fate that she desperately wanted to avoid. Instead, she went out with a bang and left behind only lingering memories of the beautiful creature that she was in her prime. This is a choice all of us who are still relatively long will also have to face one day.

Secondly, she indicates that one day the crossdressing urge suddenly just switched off, and she no longer felt that she needed to indulge. Although part of me is hoping this is true (see my post on [the problem with being a t-girl on the side](http://serenalachance.org/the-problem-with-being-a-tgirl-on-the-side), the skeptic in me is dubious. If my urge had fled completely, I hope I wouldn't find myself browsing subject specific forums, even if only occasionally.

I'm thankful for the post. At the very least it's sparked a bit of discussion in an otherwise self-focused community, and even a few original thoughts in my own all-too-rigid thinking. Anyway, this one's for you Faith, and if you're still around, you should come party in San Francisco (obviously ;)
