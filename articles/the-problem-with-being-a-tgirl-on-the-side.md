I love being a t-girl. An occasional comment on my part might suggest the opposite, but in such I'm probably only complaining about one of the less positive facets of a t-girl's glamorous life. One such facet is something I'd like to talk about today.

I'm kind of a productivity nut. I go to bed late, wake up early, don't play videogames, spend little time on meals, don't have cable, rarely watch TV and movies (should be never, but I cheat once in a while), and actively choose accommodation that's close enough to work in order to minimize transit time. In the time I save, I run, play guitar, longboard, develop my software engineering skills rigorously, meditate, and read about 30 books a year (tending toward non-fiction). I do these things because I want to accomplishment things in my life, and develop skills that matter.

But I have one vice that makes hobbies like World of Warcraft, pr0n, Glee, and Modern Warfare 3 look like casual past times, and I think you already know what it is.

If I get home at 3 PM on a Wednesday night and have no social plans, I wish that I could think to myself, "Well look at this Serena, it's time to put in a solid six hours of guitar practice, followed by a bit of running and meditation, then bed." Unfortunately, this would never happen. Instead, I can't wait until I'm fully dolled up in a cute dress, tights, heels, and have experiment with some new style of hair and makeup. After becoming Serena, I'm too high on life to do anything useful, and will normally spend the evening cooking dinner, watching a movie, doing a photo shoot, or opening a bottle of wine.

This might be a difficult concept to grasp if you're not my particular brand of t-girl, but imagine it as kind of being like an alcoholic, but addicted to being a girl instead of booze.

I can't reason with myself either. If I could decide that Tuesday will be a productive day and Wednesday I'll reward myself by hitting the streets as a tall blonde, I'd be in business, but in my experience it's just not that easy. The only trick I know to stay productive is to stay out the house: hit the coffee shop to do some programming, or do some longboarding in the park. Otherwise, the compulsive power of my libido is undeniable.

I enjoy every second that I spend as Serena, to a girl like me, dressing up is rewarding beyond words. A relevant quote often attribute to John Lennon (amongst others):

> Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.

And to some degree, the message here is certainly true, but I don't fully buy it. My time as a girl is nice, but it doesn't result in the solid personal development that I'm looking for (aside from some minor improvements in fashion, hairstyling, and makeup ;).

And that my friends, is the biggest problem with being a t-girl on the side.
