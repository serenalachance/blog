While browsing /r/crossdressing the other day, I came across this awesome video on how to do basic cleavage. Cleavage is something I've never really bothered with before in my dressing, but this trick is easy enough and looks so good that I've just started doing. Not to mention, the finished product feels pretty nice to the touch.

So what is the secret to good cleavage? Spoiler: **lots** of tape. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1-6lrraSs).
