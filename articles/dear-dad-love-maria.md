I came across this video on [Reddit here](http://www.reddit.com/r/transgender/comments/i26yk/my_god_incredibly_heart_breaking_animated_short/) about a young transexual and her relationship with her father, who appears a reasonable man in all aspects except this one.

Usually gender bending for me is all about the fun, but this video makes me sad.
