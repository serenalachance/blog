I wanted to drop a note in about how glad I was to see Anne Hathaway's incredibly sexy Catwoman costume in _the Dark Knight Rises_ come with heels (as pictured below).

It's been trendy for manifestations of Catwoman in the last decade or so, including Halle Berry's, have been portrayed with either very low heels or none at all so that the character is more realistic. Let's get something straight. By having Catwoman in your movie in the first place you've already blown right by the requirement for suspension of disbelief and firmly entered into the realm of pure fantasy, and _that's okay_. And because it's okay, it's also okay to stretch things just a little further and give Catwoman a fantastic pair of six inch heels that helps the character hit all the right nerves.

I'm still not absolutely sure about Nolan's decision to include Catwoman in his trilogy, but when it comes to costume design, he made all the right choices.
