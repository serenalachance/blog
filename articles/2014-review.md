Now that we're closing out 2014, it's a good time to review [the goals](/2014-resolutions) that I set for myself for the year and see how they went. I have a feeling that like most New Year's resolutions, most of them fell by the wayside pretty quickly.

## General Goals

> Decide whether to stay in San Francisco. Spend a good amount of time investigating the feasability of long term residence in Berlin/Germany.

I'd say that this was overall a success. I spent another month in Europe this year to see whether Berlin was somewhere that I wanted to move on a permament basis. I think that fundamentally Europe is a better fit for my personality and lifestyle, but the practical implications of not speaking the primary language and being a continent removed from everyone I know are a strong drawback to consider.

For the time being, I'm sticking around in San Francisco.

> Learn: Continue work in German.

Failed. I did a few classes, but I didn't apply enough effort to make this happen.

> Learn: Keep learning history. Branch out from Greco-Roman knowledgebase into a more diverse set of topics.

Partial success. I listened to more podcasts and read a few more books, but admittedly am still far from a historical scholar of any kind.

> Learn: Learn more about design fundamentals.

Failed. I did some nominal work, but still focused heavily on the backend.

> Run 1600 km (1000 miles). I made roughly 1100 km in 2013.

Failed. I beat out 2013 by making roughly 1350 km, but didn't make 1600. The good news is that over the last month, I've increased my average distance by 20%+ so I do have hopes that I'll finally make this in 2015.

> Give two more technical talks.

Success! They weren't fabulous, but I gave talks in Berlin and Barcelona.

> Think more (as opposed to grinding on technical work). Practice hammock-driven development.

Partial success. I think I managed to pull out of the grind a little bit, but this could still use a lot of improvement.

> Become a more active investor. I'm at a stage in my life where investment returns should be contributing non-trival amounts to my total changes in wealth. Also, with currency _probably_ devaluing more quickly than reported, it's likely a good idea to keep wealth in assets.

Failed. I made a few exchanges, but overall once again didn't spend a huge amount of time on it.

## Goals for Serena

> Lean out. The largest contributor here will be the 1600 km runs, but in general I've got a few strategies for staying more active and snacking less. Ideally, I'll be able to hit my adult low of 155 lbs. again, but I'm setting a two month goal of 165 lbs., and will re-evalute when I get there.

Failed. My weight stayed almost perfectly constant throughout the year. I'm making this a top priority for 2015.

> More daytime outings! 2013 was my best year ever for these, but there's plenty of room for improvement.

Success! I did a fair number of daytime outings and am very happy about it. Again though, this could still use even further improvement.

> Learn design fundamentals. I'm tasking Serena in particular with this topic as I'm more interested in women's fashion than men's (and design here does include some fashion work).

Failed. I continued to read design blogs and my style may have improved minutely, but I still have a long way to go here.

## Conclusion

*Successes:* 3<br>
*Failures:* 6<br>
*Partials:* 2<br>

Not counting partial successes, I hit about **33%** of my goals. While this isn't good by any means, I've had even worse years, so I'm glad to see in retrospect that I hit at least a few of them.

One major success was to run through this exercise. By examining my failures in 2014, I'm able to get a much better perspective on what I should be working toward in the coming new year. I'll be posting a new list of 2015 goals to aim for within the next few days. Stay tuned!
