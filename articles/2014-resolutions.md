I'm not that big into committing to New Year's resolutions, but I _am_ a firm believer that establishing goals and checking their progress periodically is a skill whose importance can't be overstated. Posting those goals to a mostly anonymous blog doesn't result in a huge amount of direct accountability, but I figure putting a few of them out there can't hurt.

The preliminary set of goals that I came up for my unified self (i.e. both genders), reads something like this:

* Decide whether to stay in San Francisco. Spend a good amount of time investigating the feasability of long term residence in Berlin/Germany.
* Learn:
    * Continue work in German.
    * Keep learning history. Branch out from Greco-Roman knowledgebase into a more diverse set of topics.
    * Learn more about design fundamentals.
* Run 1600 km (1000 miles). I made roughly 1100 km in 2013.
* Give two more technical talks.
* Think more (as opposed to grinding on technical work). Practice hammock-driven development.
* Become a more active investor. I'm at a stage in my life where investment returns should be contributing non-trival amounts to my total changes in wealth. Also, with currency _probably_ devaluing more quickly than reported, it's likely a good idea to keep wealth in assets.

For Serena in particular, I've set a more minimal set of goals:

* Lean out. The largest contributor here will be the 1600 km runs, but in general I've got a few strategies for staying more active and snacking less. Ideally, I'll be able to hit my adult low of 155 lbs. again, but I'm setting a two month goal of 165 lbs., and will re-evalute when I get there.
* More daytime outings! 2013 was my best year ever for these, but there's plenty of room for improvement.
* Learn design fundamentals. I'm tasking Serena in particular with this topic as I'm more interested in women's fashion than men's (and design here does include some fashion work).

I'm hoping that keeping these goals fairly conservative will help ensure that I do a better job of following up on them, but only time will tell.
