Well, that is if real girls bought their clothes online, which they don't. Rather, I've outlined below some of the online retailers that I've had great success with for girly clothing over the years, and I'm not talking about crossdresser.com. The way we're going as a society, buying all your clothing online will be the norm by the 2020's or so, and in the meantime, I'm all for being a girl who's just a little before her time.

In particular, these are retailers that I know I can get to ship to Canada. I'm sure that Americans and Europeans have their favorites too. Let me know about them!

Hot Topic
---------

<p class="ragged">I owe <a href="http://hottopic.com">Hot Topic</a> a lot. Their gothy style was one of the important inspirations that pulled me into crossdressing in my early days after hearing about them through a girlfriend at the time (there were no Canadian retail locations back then). My first Hot Topic order was also the first time I stepped into high heels, pulled on thigh-high stockings, and put on a dress to match. A turning point in my life to say the least.</p>

<p class="ragged">More recently Hot Topic's been trending towards a more emo style for girls complete with sneakers and skinny jeans. While we can always hope that it'll pass, in the meantime they still sell striking skirts, dresses, and hosiery; plus some mean heels and wedges.</p>

Due to my tragic lack of hips, I find that small skirts are a good fit, but my ungainly torso makes large tops and dresses a good idea. One thing to look out for is that some of the cheaper dresses aren't really of the highest caliber.

Abercrombie & Fitch
-------------------

<p class="ragged">I don't think all part-time ladies would agree with me here, but I've found that some of my favorite dresses and skirts are from <a href="http://abercrombie.ca">Abercrombie & Fitch</a>. In general, most of the clothing they make is nice quality, and they give you a really sexy casual look.</p>

<p class="ragged">One thing to be aware of is that Abercrombie doesn't really carry big sizes, so you'll want to be relatively trim before putting in an order there. Most items are a tad pricey too, but they'll normally hold 40% off sales a few times a year.</p>

Aldo & Spring
-------------

Great shoes at reasonable prices can be had at [Aldo](http://aldoshoes.com) and [Spring](http://http://www.myspringshoes.com). A selection of platform high heels is available year round and you'll always be able to find something to match your latest outfit, no matter what the season.

Being a mainstream shoe retailer, the sizes fit smaller than brands that deal with big platforms and fetish footwear. While I'd buy big Devious mary janes in size 10, I'll almost always go size 11 with Aldo and Spring for a better fit. Be careful with knee and over-the-knee boots too, most of us have longer legs than our genetic counterparts.

Forever 21

<p class="ragged"><a href="http://forever21.com">Forever 21</a> was recommended to me recently by a local friend with similar interests. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot to say about them having not yet put in an order. What I will say though is that they've got some great looking clothing, a huge selection, and some heels tall enough that even <em>I</em> find them fashionable! Best of all: they're cheap. The dress shown on the right retails for <a href="http://canada.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=H1981&Category=dress&ProductID=2074983066">C$27.90</a>!</p>

<p class="ragged">I'll be sure to post a mini-review once I've got a few of their dresses and shoes in hand.</p>
