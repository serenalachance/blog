Reading back through my own posts here, it didn't take long to come to the realization that actual content on this blog is exceedingly lacking in both originality, depth, and any other metric you'd want to measure it by. In short, the content here sucks, and there's no compelling reason anyone would ever want to read this stuff.

This is just a public announcement that I'm aware of the situation and will be actively working on improving the situation over the next few months.
