Serena is in love! Pretty soon she'll be walking through the parks, midsummer sun in the sky, breeze through her hair, butterflies in the air, denim wrapping her hips, and her new Spiney wedge heels on her feet.

The second part of my Aldo shoe order arrived today and was made up of a pair of sandal wedges that I'd ordered for the warm weather. Aldo describes the Spineys as:

> Espadrille-style sandals are a key choice for the upcoming spring-summer season. Get maximum attention with this wedge platform option with t-strap upper design and side buckle detail.

However you choose to describe them, the Spineys are beautifully detailed and very comfortable to wear. I'll certainly be walking miles in them over the next few months.

Although I have nothing bad to say about them, it should be noted that the heel height isn't *quite* as high as the perspective in the picture below suggests. That's probably a good thing for most girls, and make them only *slightly* more boring for girls like me.
