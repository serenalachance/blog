I was just reading about an event called Diva Las Vegas, described as not a convention, but a _vacation_ and my heart was warmed when I came across [their FAQ page](http://www.geekbabe.com/cgi-bin/afaq.cgi?i=/dlv/faq).

Anybody who was around at the time would see the immediate connection between this FAQ and documents from an older era of the Internet, a time when usenet was a prolific form of comunication and hackers were the gatekeepers to the web. The information is presented in a way which favors content over colorful layout, a format that just doesn't belong in the ADD-fueled Facebook world of today.

Taking a quick peek at the event's history, I wasn't too surprised to find out that it was based on a group formed around an EFNet channel. The community on Reddit's established a pretty successful Freenode channel, but seeing something built around EFNet lends a certain amount of hacker prestige that can only be explained subjectively by looking at history from bygone days.

Diva looks like an awesome event though. I really hope to make it out there one year.
