Most people watched Tron and were wowed by the special effects and fancy lighting. Some people watched Tron and thought that Olivia Wilde and Beau Garrett looked really cute as computer characters in the digital frontier. Very few people watched Tron and immediately decided that they had to reproduce one of Olivia or Beau's costumes for a rave or Halloween 2011. Sadly, count me into the latter group.

Here's a promotional shot of Tron Legacy's Quorra, embodied by ever sexy Mrs. Wilde.

A few days ago, I noticed that some wedge heels by Aldo known as Verdones went on sale, and since I just can't resist wedges of any kind, I put in an order. Well, they arrived yesterday and they're awesome! Unlike some wedges, you get a bit of height of these heels at about 5" or so, and yet they're still easy to walk in. These combined with a little [EL wire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroluminescent_wire), and a jagged wig are going to make a great Quorra costume.

Here's a few pictures of the sexy Verdone heels; take special note of the yummy back zipper detail!
