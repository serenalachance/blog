So tonight I got home and on pure impulse I threw on some cute tights, short dress, [my Verdone wedge heels](//serenalachance.org/articles/verdone-boots-and-my-quorra-costume), a bit of makeup, a blonde wig, and suddenly found myself transformed into Serena! (On these occasions, I always realize that I spend way too much time as a boring guy, but that's beside the point)

Well Serena's not really a homebody, so I went out to run a few chores like driving down to the ATM, getting gas, and sitting on the park bench for a few minutes to admire the beautiful night sky. During my time out, a few muggles saw me: a few guys walking their dogs, a guy who stepped out of the local bar to have a smoke, and a random who was biking around the parking lot.

I'm a little disappointed in myself with respect to how nervous these couple tranny sightings made me. I'm not sure exactly how passable I am, but I don't think I look too bad, albeit a little tall for a girl (this is of course entirely the fault of my big wedge heels that somehow manage to strap themselves to my feet every time I try to leave the house). Another condition working in my favor was that it was already dark out, probably making my disguised XY nature harder to spot still.

The guy in the bike even changed course to pass take a closer look at me, which I'll take take as a subtle compliment.

And yet, I still had that worried feeling deep in the pit of my stomach.

Reading deeper into the problem, I don't think that it's _just_ the worry about my ability to pass. An even greater fear for me is that if someone asks me a question or makes a comment, I'll give myself away once I'm at close proximity, or have to respond.

I really don't know what to do about this except continue to go out, and hope that my confidence builds as I move around outside more often.

Passability
-----------

I did a bit of Googling today on how to tell if you're passable. Most of the answers to this kind of question are pretty useless, but one in particular struck me as a great idea: 

> Get some sunglasses and walk around in public during the day. The sunglasses will allow you to observe how other people react to you. If you see that people aren't generally doing double takes, then you're passing.

Of course, for this to work you'll probably have to wear those boring "normal people" clothes.

I've already got some super cute sunglasses, so I'm making it one of my goals to go out during the day and give this a shot. I have to know!

Well, I just put on my eight inch platforms and almost fell over. That means it's time for bed. Goodnight!
